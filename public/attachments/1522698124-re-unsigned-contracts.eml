After reviewing the unsigned contracts in the system, I have discovered 
a few causes that contributed.

 1. Step 4 of Batch Renewals only shows contracts for this fiscal year
    that have been signed by the club contact, but not Campbell
    personnel. This means if a club contact stalls on signing until the
    fiscal year passes, the contract may never be noticed if no one is
    watching the Unsigned Contracts report until next billing cycle.
    SOLUTION: I have adjusted the Step 4 Batch Renewals interface to
    ignore the fiscal year. It will show all contracts that need
    execution regardless of when. I also want unsigned contracts to
    stand out in the back office. If a club contact is stalling,
    administrators need to know so they can be notified.
 2. There is simply insufficient motivation for club contacts to sign
    their contracts under some circumstances. At the present time, a
    club contact will encounter a popup dialogue demanding a signature
    before being allowed to pay their lease online. However, their
    contract will sit there for an extended period of time if their
    lease was billed to a previous contract and had since been reissued
    or amended for whatever reason. There is no reason to login and sign
    it until next billing cycle, so the contacts don't. SOLUTION: We
    need a weekly cron that e-mails club contacts periodically to remind
    them to login and sign their contracts.
 3. DocuSign expires contracts that sit in their system for too long.
    Once expired, they cannot be signed. This doesn't prevent anyone
    from noticing and reporting it, but it is an inconvenience causing
    some contacts who had previously signed to have to do it again.
    SOLUTION: I will dig into the DocuSign documentation to see if I can
    disable contract expiration. I don't know if this is even a thing.
    It appears to be a default behavior, but I'll see if I can extended
    it for longer if not turn it off. If not, we'll need another cron
    that monitors for contract expiration and notifies Campbell (or just
    automatically reissues the contract).
 4. _A side concern:_ Brian Gowin expressed a lot of concern that
    payments are being accepted with no signed contract. I found several
    cases of invoices being paid by ACH right after signing, but the
    contract expired before execution by Campbell personnel. I also
    found several examples of checks by mail being entered before a
    contract had been returned. I found cases where a contract was never
    submitted to DocuSign at all (usually because the contact had no
    e-mail address), but the contact was allowed to pay because the
    popup dialogue can't display a DocuSign signing dialogue without a
    DocuSign ID. SOLUTION: The back office Add Payment form is too
    unintelligent. I'd like to adjust the form so that it enforces the
    need to have a signed contract in the system before being allowed to
    enter a check. I do not have an appealing solution for customers
    that are mailing in their contract who want to pay online except to
    stop them from paying until a Campbell administrator scans in their
    contract. This would be slow and tedious for the customer, but I
    have no way of detecting the status of a paper contract until it is
    scanned.
 5. I found a very small number of cases where a contract had been
    signed and executed, but someone reissued it anyway thus exhibiting
    the appearance of payments having been made on a contract that had
    not been signed. SOLUTION: I want to disable this capability in the
    event a contract has been executed. If the contract needs to be
    amended, there is a "Terminate Lease" tool that serves this purpose.
    Direct editing of a completed contract seems to be a bad idea.

RECOVERY

Fixing the contracts we currently have in the system will be simple, but 
tedious -- especially given the timing. I have to individually reissue 
the expired contracts through DocuSign and club contacts will simply 
need to sign them. In some cases, the contact will have already signed 
the contract and will have to do so again. I tried to find a solution 
around this (i.e. perhaps printing the contract from DocuSign, signing 
it, and scanning it back in), but this seems to be impossible. DocuSign 
watermarks expired contracts as voided. In either case, once they sign 
the contracts, everything will be right again.
